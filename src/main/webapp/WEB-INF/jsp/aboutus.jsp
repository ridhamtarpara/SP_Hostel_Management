							Shree Saurastra Patel Kelavani Mandal was established on 4th
							October 1953 in the meeting at Dr. Haribhai Gauda's house. At
							that time, hostels have been established in Amreli, Bhavnagar,
							Jamnagar and Dhoraji. But all these hostels were only for school
							students. There was not any such type of facility for college
							students. Gujarat Education Society was instituted during this
							time and Engineering, Medical, Pharmacy, Commerce, Laws etc.
							courses were introduced at new colleges. So hostel facility in
							Ahmedabad was required. For this, land for hostel establishment
							was bought in 1955 and hostel was started in 1957 with small
							building of 8 rooms. As time went there was requirement for extra
							rooms so in 1959 extra 5 rooms, in 1962 new floor with 5 rooms
							and 4 rooms in 1968 were built. Finally in 1968, two storey
							building with 22 rooms was prepared for students who wanted to
							study in Ahmedabad. M. Patel engineering Company Ltd., Mumbai
							donated Rs.25, 000 and Shree Gokalbhai Darabar of Surat donated
							Rs.22, 000. These were the main donations in the construction. <br />

							The building of Hostel was ready but they didn't have dining hall
							so students had to sit in the corridor to dine but they faced
							problems in rainy season. At that time our society was doing
							great economic progress. For satisfying increasing needs of
							students, new floor's construction was initiated on "VijyaDashmi"
							at 8 October 1981. At that time Shree Vrajlal (Nanubhai) Zinabhai
							Shiroya, Shree Nathala Jivarajbhai Devani, Shree Bhikhubhai
							Nanjibhai Padsala and Shree Hakamichandbhai Patel donated Rs.1,
							11,111 each and Shree Mohanbhai Valjibhai Vadaliya donated Rs.40,
							000. Besides this donation, Rs.11, 00,000 were announced as total
							donation. Also from the very beginning girl’s education and
							empowerment had been the aim of our organization. So 1.17 acre
							land for girl’s hostel was bought near AEC Sola Cross Road,
							Naranpura. But this land was under reservation of AUDA’s old
							environmental belt area, so the governmental procedure to relieve
							this land was started in 1992. <br /> <img class="abtimg"
								src="<c:url value='/dist/img/opning.jpg'/>"><br /> Due to
							delay in that process, spirit of unity and tendency of donation
							were improved. On 12th November 1995 it was decided in the
							conference of board members to demolish old building and
							construct new high-rise building for better use of land. The
							blueprints of building designed under observation of planning
							committee were approved from Corporation. So old building was
							demolished in April 1996 and construction of new building was
							initiated on 21st April 1996. Hard work of activists and
							cooperation of donors have paid off in the construction of the
							building. In this new building there are 160 rooms with capacity
							of 4 students each, well facilitated dining hall with capacity of
							110 students, hall, kitchen, a large cultural hall, library,
							computer room, TV room, offices, parking, newly furnished another
							dining hall etc. Besides this building another new building for
							higher courses like engineering, medical, MBA, CA etc. with
							capacity of 220 students is also constructed. <br /> <br /> <img

							After completing construction of boy’s hostel, Shree
							Vallabhbhai G. Kakadiya, Shree Ravjibhai P. Vasani, Late Shree
							Pareshbhai Pansuriya, Shree Gunavantbhai B. Sojitra, Shree
							Parshottambhai Gevariya, Shree Valjibhai Domadiya, Shree Kanubhai
							J. Patel, Shree Babubhai Sheladiya, Shree Nanubhai Parsana and
							Shree Bhikhubhai Sojitra all together started realizing a dream
							of girl’s hostel. Shree Dirubhai Bhagat donated Rs.1, 50,
							00,000 for girl’s hostel. So Saurastra Patel Kelavani Mandal,
							Ahmedabad organized Shreemati Vijyaben Maganbhai Nagajibhai
							Bhagat Girls Hostel (accommodation of about 860 girls) was
							initiated by Chief Minister of Gujarat on 2nd January 2008 and
							was inaugurated by Chief Minister of Gujarat then and now Prime
							Minister of India, Shree Narendra Modi. Shree Babubhai Sheladiya,
							Shree Rambhai Sheladiya, Shree Nanubhai Parsana, Shree Himmatbhai
							Kasvala, Shree Vallabhbhai Kakadiya, Shree Ravjibhai Vasani,
							Shree Gunavantbhai Sojitra have placed their best efforts to
							complete this work in minimal time without worrying about their
							own businesses. <br /> <br />
